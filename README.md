# Cloud Architecture Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive cloud architecture design for the client's web application platform, focusing on four critical areas: Cloud Environment Structure, Network Design, Compute Platform, and Database Architecture. The design is built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and optimized for scalability, security, and operational excellence.

## Cloud Provider Selection: AWS vs Google Cloud Platform

### Why Amazon Web Services (AWS) Was Selected

After thorough evaluation of both AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), **Amazon Web Services** was selected as the primary cloud provider for the client's infrastructure. This decision is based on comprehensive analysis across technical capabilities, business requirements, cost considerations, and strategic factors.

#### 1. **Enterprise-Grade Multi-Account Strategy**

**AWS Organizations Capabilities:**
- **AWS Organizations** provides mature, battle-tested multi-account management with fine-grained billing, service control policies (SCPs), and centralized governance
- **Complete Account Isolation** ensures true resource separation between environments (Dev, Staging, Production, Shared Services, Management)
- **Cross-Account IAM** offers sophisticated role assumption and resource sharing capabilities
- **Consolidated Billing** enables volume discounts, reserved instance sharing, and detailed cost allocation
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** can enforce security and compliance policies across all accounts
- **Account-level resource limits** prevent one environment from affecting others
- **Cross-account resource sharing** allows ECR, KMS keys, and other services to be shared securely

**GCP Projects and Organizations:**
- **Google Cloud Projects** serve as the primary resource container, similar to AWS accounts
- **Google Cloud Organizations** provide hierarchical structure but with different capabilities
- **Folders** can group projects but lack the sophisticated policy enforcement of AWS SCPs
- **Billing accounts** can be shared across projects but without the granular controls of AWS
- **IAM inheritance** works through the hierarchy but is less mature than AWS cross-account roles
- **Resource sharing** between projects requires different mechanisms and is less streamlined
- **Project-level isolation** is good but not as comprehensive as AWS account-level separation

**Key Differences for Enterprise Management:**
- **Policy Enforcement**: AWS SCPs provide preventive controls that can block actions across accounts, while GCP relies more on detective controls
- **Billing Granularity**: AWS provides more detailed cost allocation and chargeback capabilities per account
- **Resource Isolation**: AWS accounts provide stronger isolation boundaries compared to GCP projects
- **Cross-Environment Access**: AWS cross-account IAM is more mature and flexible than GCP's cross-project mechanisms

#### 2. **Container Orchestration and Cost Optimization**

**AWS Amazon EKS Capabilities:**
- **Deep AWS Integration**: Native integration with VPC networking, IAM, CloudWatch, Application Load Balancer, and over 150+ AWS services

**Key Differences for Enterprise Decision-Making:**
- **Cost Optimization Sophistication**: Karpenter's intelligent instance selection provides superior cost optimization compared to GKE's more basic preemptible instance approach
- **Flexibility vs Simplicity**: AWS EKS offers more granular control for complex enterprise requirements, while GKE Autopilot prioritizes simplicity over customization
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: AWS has a larger third-party ecosystem of Kubernetes operators and tools specifically built for EKS
